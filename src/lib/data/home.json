      "I'm Lukas Barragan Torres, a first year Computer Science master student with a passion for all things tech. I enjoy modelling problems and creating solutions in a simple and elegant way. My passion for tech started at 14 when I built a side scrolling adventure game with scratch. Later on, I learned to code in Python and Java.",
      "My studies have provided me with a broad understanding of various facets of computer science. While I may not specialize deeply in one area, this diverse knowledge allows me to see the bigger picture, make connections between different concepts, and approach problems from multiple angles.",
      "When I'm not behind a screen, I enjoy spending time swimming, mastering chess, going to the gym and spending time with my girlfriend Charlotte. As an avid Linux user and an open-source enthusiast, I'm captivated by the ways free technology is shaping our future. In my spare time, I work on various projects that help me apply and deepen my technical skills. Feel free to explore more about me and let's connect!"
