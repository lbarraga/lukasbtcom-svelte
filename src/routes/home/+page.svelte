                👋 Hello, I'm Lukas Barragan Torres,
                a third-year Computer Science 🎓 student with a burning passion for all things tech 💻.
                Outside of my studies, I cherish the moments spent with my wonderful girlfriend, Charlotte Lenders ❤️.
                When we're not exploring the digital world together, I enjoy spending time swimming 🏊,
                mastering chess ♟️, and hitting the gym 🏋️‍♂️. As an avid Linux user 🐧 and an AI enthusiast 🤖,
                I'm captivated by the ways technology is shaping our future. It's a field I aspire to make my mark in 🌠.
                🛠️ In my spare time, I work on various projects that help me apply and deepen my technical skills 🌱.
                Feel free to explore more about me and let's connect! 👥
